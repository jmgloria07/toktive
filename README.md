## About
Toktive (name not final, suggestions are appreciated) is an API that allows a client/consumer to share their post to all networks in a single action. For now the plan is to make FB and Twitter share work utilizing other third-party APIs for each network.

## Motivation
Ever thought of a post, but ran into the hassle of opening all those apps and having to share it to each and everyone of them? This is the problem every social media manager faces everyday.

All that said, I'm not that heavy of a poster that needs to do all those things. I might not even think of wasting phone memory to install this app. **The main goal of this project is actually to** let me practice what I'm learning about Spring/Boot, Design Patterns, JPA, etc. I feel like I'm lagging behind on what technologies I know. Youtube, Udemy, and other references online are not enough-- everyone knows that. We need to get our hands dirty, make mistakes, and experience firsthand how to work with them.

## Future plans
- Support Twitter share via Twitter4J
- Lookup for any API that would let me post to FB
- Will utilize property files to work with access tokens, but planning to extend this further to use a DB (H2, perhaps?).
- Make a separate web project that uses this API, could be Angular/React this time.
- The API is highly extensible, so a smartphone app can use this.
